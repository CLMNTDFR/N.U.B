# North Underground Bands (N.U.B)
I transformed the project into a web application akin to a social network. The primary goal of this network is to share groups from the Lille underground music scene. A user can authenticate to share various information about a music group, such as contact details, merchandise, and events using typical "CRUD" operations.


For now, I've named this interface N.U.B for "North Underground Bands". Feel free to explore the site and navigate through structured data.


I am open to any suggestions for improvement!
