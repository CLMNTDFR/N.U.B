# North Underground Bands (N.U.B)
Welcome to this repository dedicated to my first side-project as a programming student.
I transformed the project into a web application akin to a social network. The primary goal of this network is to share groups from the Lille underground music scene. A user can authenticate to share various information about a music group, such as contact details, merchandise, and events using typical "CRUD" operations.


For now, I've named this interface N.U.B for "North Underground Bands". Feel free to explore the site and navigate through structured data.


I am open to any suggestions for improvement!

<hr>
Here you can find an overview from a new user's point of view:
- The user must create an account to access the content.
- He can also edit his account, add a profile photo, or delete it.
- He can also create objects (Bands / Merch / Events) and perform classic CRUD operations on the objects he owns.

<br>

- By navigating through the lists of objects, the user will see that they are sorted by their first letter.
- A functional like counter is also implemented for the "Band" and "Merch" objects.<br>

- By accessing a "Band" object, a music player is visible if and only if the content creator downloads wav or mp3 files.
- When creating a "Band" or "Merch" object, the user can upload a photo, otherwise a default image is assigned to the object.<br>

- A “classified ads” system is also implemented on the home page. A user can respond directly to an ad via N.U.B's integrated messaging.
- The user can also access all their messages via a "social network messenger" type interface.

- Finally, the classic “About” and “Contact” pages allow the user to find out more about N.U.B, consult the terms of policy or contact the admin.
